= Editing the code of applications running in OpenShift Container Platform using {prod-short}

This section describes how to start editing the source code of applications running on OpenShift using {prod-short}.

.Prerequisites

* {prod-short} is deployed on the same OpenShift 4.2 cluster or later
* An existing workspace in {prod-short}

.Procedure

. Open the *Topology* view to list all projects.

.Additional resources

* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the procedure module.
* Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
* For more details on writing procedure modules, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles. For tips, see _Anchor Names and File Names_ in link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
